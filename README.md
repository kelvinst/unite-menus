# unite-menus

A unite.vim plugin that defines some useful functions for the menu definitions.

## Installation

If you don't have any preferred installation method, I recommend using vundler.
So you just need to put this in your `.vimrc`

```bash
Plugin "kelvinst/unite-menus"
```

And then run:

```
:PluginInstall
```

## Usage

Refer to `:h unite-menus` if you need to know how to use it.
