INTRODUCTION                            *unite-menus-introduction* *unite-menus*

If you like the menus functionality of unite, but you find it a little
reapeating to define the commands, the keymap for them and linking everything,
this plugin is for you!

The main function is the |unite_menus#Define|. Keep scrolling to find its
documentation.

VARIABLES                                                *unite-menus-variables*

                                                          *g:unite_menus_keymap*
g:unite_menus_keymap      This is the default keymap of unite menus. If you type
                          it no normal mode, it will open a list of all the
                          menus you have defined using this plugin. This
                          variable is also used to create |relative_keymap| on
                          menus.

                          A good idea is to map it to something easy like:
>
        let g:unite_menus_keymap = '<Leader><Leader>'
<

                          Default value:

>
        let g:unite_menus_keymap = '<Leader>/'
<

FUNCTIONS                                                *unite-menus-functions*

unite_menus#Define        This method will define a brand new unite menu,
                          following some conventions of style. The signature
                          is the following:
