                              menu
  candidates   Dictionary     The menu candidates to be defined, the key will be
                              used for the menu description, and each key of the
                              dictionary must point to another dictionary with
                              the following config:
    keymap         Dictionary The keymap that will be used to directly call the
                              candidate command
    command        String     The command that needs to be executed when
                              the candidate is selected
    command_action String     Accepts the strings: 'execute' and 'complete'. And
                              defines what needs to be done with the command
                              when you select the menu item.
